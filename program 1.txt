In Django, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are used to map web requests to specific views or functions within your application. They define the structure of the URLs that your application will respond to and determine which view function should be called to handle a particular URL pattern.




# urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),  # Maps the root URL to the index view
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),  # Maps the /about/ URL to the about view
    path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),  # Maps the /contact/ URL to the contact view
]


# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the index page.")

def about(request):
    return HttpResponse("This is the about page.")

def contact(request):
    return HttpResponse("Contact us at example@example.com.")
